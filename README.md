# Project Title: Machine Learning and Neural Network Application

## Overview
This project involves the development of a machine learning and neural network model based on two datasets, with a focus on data preprocessing, model development, and web application creation. The web application will demonstrate the models' functionality and provide insights into their development process.

  - **Missing Data**: [Explain any missing values or incomplete data and how you plan to handle them]

- **Dataset 2**: [Dataset name, e.g., 'MNIST Dataset']
  - **Source**: [Where you obtained the dataset]
  - **Features**: [List of features]
  - **Missing Data**: [Explanation of missing data and preprocessing steps]

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Data cleaning steps including handling missing values, outlier detection, and feature scaling.
- Transformation steps (e.g., one-hot encoding, normalization, etc.)
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

### 3. Machine Learning Model Development (Dataset 1)
- **Algorithm Used**: [List the algorithms tried, e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.]
- **Model Evaluation**: Performance metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, etc.)
- **Training and Testing Results**: [Summarize the performance of each algorithm on the dataset]

### 4. Neural Network Model Development (Dataset 2)
- **Model Design**: [Describe the architecture of the neural network, e.g., number of layers, activation functions, etc.]
- **Training Details**: [Explain the training process including loss function, optimizer, and training duration]
- **Performance**: [Evaluate the neural network model on test data]

### 5. Web Application
A web application is developed using [Streamlit/Flask/Other Framework] that includes:
1. **Page 1**: Data Preprocessing Overview
   - Explanation of the data collection, preprocessing steps, and handling of missing values.
2. **Page 2**: Machine Learning Model Development
